<h1>The Best Movies According to Karan</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</h3>
  <p>This is my favourite holiday film. The comedic adventures of Kevin McCallister in the Big Apple are both heartwarming
    and hilarious.</p>

  <h3>Kedarnath</h3>
  <p>A poignant love story set against the backdrop of the devastating 2013 Uttarakhand floods, Kedarnath combines romance
    and tragedy in a way that leaves a lasting impact. The breathtaking visuals and emotional narrative make this film a
    personal favorite.</p>

  <h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
  <p>This timeless classic explores the transformative power of education and inspiration. The story of students at Welton
    Academy and their charismatic English teacher, John Keating, is both thought-provoking and emotionally stirring. Dead
    Poets Society is a cinematic masterpiece that resonates with me on many levels.</p>
